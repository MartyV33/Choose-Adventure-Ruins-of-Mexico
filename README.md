## Instructions
This is a "Choose Your Own Adventure" game set in the mysterious Ruins of Mexico. Players will navigate through various choices that impact the story and uncover hidden secrets. Make the correct choices and find your way through the ruins to the treasured altar!

### Introductional Overview

Set in an ancient part of Mexico. Deep in the mountains, you find a large archway sticking out of the
ground with some ancient looking symbols all around the curve of the arch. Youve been sent here to
find an Altar deep in some ruins hidden somewhere in these mountains. You had a team of followers
helping you find the way, unfortunately they were lost to the spirits that haunt this mountain range.
Now its up to you to find the lost Altar of Coatepec!

### Background info

Picking a "Choose your own adventure game" was an easy choice for me! Being a retired DM(Dungeon Master) or (Game Master) this was a no brainer. I have always enjoyed making up stories and giving different outcomes that the player can approach. I have made a 75 page Adventure in a word document that i am very proud of, and yet still to be finished. Also have yet to get a party to even complete up to what i have finished. SO that was a nice touch.

### Planned Future Enhancements

To give this game more enhancements, i would like of to added music/noises to each scene to give it more depth. I would love to add more scenes to the game as well. Such as giving them more options past reaching the final scene. Stretching past the final goal and giving the player another decision to possibly find more treasure in another hidden room. Maybe with more puzzles? I enjoy what i have so far, but wish i could of done more always!
